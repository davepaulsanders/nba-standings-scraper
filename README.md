# NBA Standings Scraper

After realizing an API I was using did not have access to wins or standings, I developed this app as a module to include in my other NBA data project.

## Installation

1. `git clone` the repository
2. `npm install` for dependencies
3. `npm start` to start app in node

## Technologies

This app uses puppeteer, which you can read about [here.](https://pptr.dev/)
